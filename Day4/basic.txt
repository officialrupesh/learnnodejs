NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules.
What is Package?
A package in Node.js contains all files that we need for a module.
Modules are javascript libraries you can include in your project

Download a Package?
Open command line interface and tell NPM to download the package you want
I want to download a package called "upper-case":

Download "upper-case"":::::

npm install upper-case

NPM now create a folder named "node_modules", where the package will be placed.
All package installed will be placed in the folder.
Now the package will have C:\Users\PROJECT\node_modules\upper-case

USING A PACKAGE
-> Once the package is installed, it is ready to use 
Include the "upper-case" package the same way we include other modules
In this case
var uc = require('upper-case');
